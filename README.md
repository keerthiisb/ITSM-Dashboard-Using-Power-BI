# ITSM-Dashboard-Using-Power-BI

Overview

This project provides an interactive Power BI dashboard that visualizes key metrics of IT incident management. It features an incident summary, reassignment analysis, urgency and priority filters, and monthly trends to help IT teams make data-driven decisions.

Key Features

Incident Summary: A comprehensive overview displaying the total number of incidents (46,606), categorized into various types such as incidents, requests for information, complaints, and requests for change.

Reassignment Analysis: A detailed look into the reassignment counts by Configuration Item Category (CI_Cat), with a focus on the categories with the highest reassignments.

Urgency and Priority Filters: Interactive sliders and buttons to filter incidents based on their urgency and priority levels.

Incident Status by CI Category: A table showcasing the number of closed and work-in-progress incidents across different CI categories, highlighting key areas like 'application' with the most significant numbers.

Monthly Trends: A bar chart illustrating the monthly distribution of incidents, with notable peaks in January, October, and December.

Objectives

To identify trends and patterns in incident management.

To highlight areas requiring improvement or additional resources.

To assist IT service teams in making data-driven decisions.

Tools and Technologies

Power BI: For data visualization and dashboard creation.

ITSM Data Sources: Data extracted from ITSM tool.

Analysis Techniques

In this ITSM project, various analysis techniques are employed to provide a comprehensive overview of incident management. These include categorizing incidents into types such as incidents, requests for information, complaints, and requests for change. Reassignment analysis by Configuration Item Category (CI_Cat) helps identify which categories experience the most reassignments. The project also uses urgency and priority filters to allow detailed analysis based on these factors. Additionally, the data is visualized to show the number of incidents by month and the status of incidents within different CI categories, thus offering insights into trends and areas needing improvement.

Results

The Power BI dashboard effectively visualizes key metrics related to incident management. Highlights include:

Total Incidents: 46,606 incidents categorized as incidents, requests for information, complaints, and requests for change.

Reassignment Analysis: A bar chart detailing the highest reassignments by Configuration Item (CI) categories such as application, subapplication, and displayed device.

Urgency and Priority Filters: Interactive filters allowing analysis based on urgency and priority levels.

Incident Status by CI Category: A table showing the status of incidents (closed, work-in-progress) across different CI categories.

Monthly Trends: A bar chart displaying the count of incidents per month, identifying peak periods.

This comprehensive visualization helps in identifying trends, analyzing performance, and pinpointing areas for improvement in incident management.
